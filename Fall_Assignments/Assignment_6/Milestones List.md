# Milestones List

* UI Design Mock-up: This will allow us to create a reference of what we want the UI to look like and how the app is navigated through.
* Nitty Gritty Design Diagrams: We have some rather high level diagrams of how our application will interact with other technologies. But it would be very useful to think through our domain objects, how they will be used and what information we need where. That will especially be very important for when we create the DB and API.
* Application: UI hardcoded with data to allow interaction.
* API/Service(s): Most likely a REST service that will allow the UI to retrieve data, save meal plans, and do anything else that would require our database or some specific logic.
* Database: This will probably be a SQL relational DB, we need to create multiple tables. That would be recipes and meal plans for the basis of our idea.
