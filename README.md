## Project Abstract
The Fresh Bagels is a solution to healthy at-home eating. Our goal is to provide users with the ability to curate meal plans that are customized to each user's specific health requirements and streamline the process for them to easily put into action these meal plans.

***
## Project Description
The purpose of our project is to create an application that will solve a very common problem for many people, “What do I eat today?” Many people today live very busy lives and do not make the time to structure their meals how they really want. So instead they eat a lot of unhealthy meals because they seem to be the only option for their schedule.

With our application we hope to give users an easy way to answer the question and have a Meal Plan that suits their health needs best. The application will gather a user’s nutritional requirements and comprise a meal plan that meets the needs of each individual user.
